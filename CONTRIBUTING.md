## Reporting Issues & Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs & Improvements

I use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to How-To-Open-Source. I encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, I will ask you to join the previous discussion.

## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

To prevent multiple people working on the same issue and causing conflicts, please put a comment on the issue.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint.git
```

## Sending a Pull Request

The whole purpose behind this project is to get people contributing however large or small the contribution. Whether it be _fixing a bug_ or _adding a feature_ submit changes via a Pull Request.

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Be assigned to an existing issue or open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint/issues).
- Fork the repo.
- Make sure all tests, linting, and type-checking pass.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. I may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
